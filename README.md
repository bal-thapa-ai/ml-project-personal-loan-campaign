# 💳 Personal Loan Campaign – Machine Learning Project  

## 📌 Overview  
AllLife Bank, a US-based financial institution, wants to increase its personal loan customer base. This project applies **machine learning classification models** to predict which liability customers are most likely to purchase personal loans, enabling targeted marketing campaigns.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Predict whether a liability customer will buy a personal loan  
- Identify customer attributes that influence loan purchase decisions  
- Provide insights to improve marketing campaign effectiveness

## 📂 Dataset  
⚠️ *Dataset not included due to university policy*  
- The notebook expects a structured CSV dataset (`personal_loan_data.csv`)  
- You may create a dummy dataset with similar features for demonstration  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack / Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy / Pandas** – data manipulation & analysis  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)** – handling class imbalance

## 📊 Key Steps  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified feature distributions and patterns  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, scaled features  
3. **Model Building:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting/XGBoost  
4. **Model Evaluation:** Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC  
5. **Business Insights:** Identified key drivers (income, balance, education, experience, etc.)
